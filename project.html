The wings, bodies, and legs, like those of moths, are covered with dustlike scales that come off when the animal is handled. Unlike moths, butterflies are active during the day and are usually brightly coloured or strikingly patterned. Perhaps the most distinctive physical features of the butterfly are its club-tipped antennae and its habit of holding the wings vertically over the back when at rest.
<h2><u>Life Cycle of Butterfly</u></h2>
 1.The lepidopteran life cycle has four stages: egg, larva (caterpillar), pupa (chrysalis), and adult (imago).<br> 2.The larvae and adults of most butterflies feed on plants, often only specific parts of specific types of plants.

1. Pieridae, the whites and sulfurs, known for their mass migrations; <br>2.Papilionidae, the swallowtails and parnassians;<br>3. Lycaenidae, including the blues, coppers, hairstreaks, and gossamer-winged butterflies;<br>4. Riodinidae, the metalmarks, found chiefly in the American tropics; <br>5.Nymphalidae, the brush-footed butterflies; Hesperiidae, the skippers; <br>6. Hedylidae, the American moth-butterflies (sometimes considered a sister group to Papilionoidea). <br><br>
